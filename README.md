## Uses

The SQL Coder model is designed to assist users in generating, optimizing, and understanding SQL queries. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the model provides accurate and efficient SQL code solutions based on user inputs, making it an invaluable tool for both novice and experienced database administrators, developers, and data analysts.

### Direct Use

Efficiently generate, optimize, and debug SQL queries from natural language descriptions, enhancing productivity and query performance for developers and data analysts.

### Downstream Use

Enhance database management, improve data retrieval speed, support advanced data analysis, and aid in learning SQL by providing clear explanations and optimized query solutions.

### Out-of-Scope Use

Out of scope uses for the SQL Coder model include generating SQL queries for unsupported or non-relational databases, performing complex database administration tasks such as backup and restore, providing comprehensive data visualization and reporting tools, and writing application-specific business logic outside of SQL queries.
